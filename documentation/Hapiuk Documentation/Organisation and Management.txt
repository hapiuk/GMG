Organisation and Management
Company Structure:

Hapiuk will be structured as a small business entity, with a focus on streamlined operations to minimise overhead and maximise efficiency. Given the nature of the business, the initial structure will be relatively flat, with the founder (you) handling most of the operations, including development, client interaction, and business administration. As the business grows, additional roles may be added to support specific functions, such as project management, customer support, and sales.

Management Approach:

Hapiuk will adopt an agile management approach, which is well-suited for the fast-paced and ever-changing nature of web development projects. Agile allows for flexibility in responding to client needs and market changes, ensuring that projects are completed efficiently and to a high standard.

Project Management:

Projects will be broken down into manageable phases, with regular client check-ins and reviews.
A focus on iterative development ensures that the client can see progress and provide feedback early and often.
Tools such as Trello or Asana will be used to track project tasks and timelines.
Client Communication:

Clear, consistent communication will be prioritised to ensure that clients are kept informed at every stage of the project.
Regular updates will be provided, and clients will have the opportunity to review and approve work at key milestones.
A client portal may be developed in the future to streamline communication and project management.
Growth and Scalability:

As the business grows, the plan is to bring on additional staff or freelancers to handle increased workloads.
A focus on automation, particularly in the deployment of websites, will help manage growth without a significant increase in overhead.
The company will explore partnerships and collaborations to expand service offerings and reach a broader market.
Legal Structure:

Hapiuk will initially operate as a sole proprietorship, which allows for simplicity in management and tax filing. However, as the business grows, it may be beneficial to consider forming a limited company (Ltd) to limit personal liability and provide a more formal structure. This decision will depend on the growth trajectory and financial performance of the business.

Advisors and Mentors:

While Hapiuk may not have a formal board of advisors initially, seeking mentorship from experienced professionals in the web development and business sectors will be crucial. These advisors can provide guidance on strategic decisions, financial management, and market expansion.

Quote Calculation Prototype
To make it easier to generate quotes for clients, you can develop a simple calculator (using a spreadsheet or web-based tool) that allows you to input the following:

Number of sections
Modules Required (e.g., E-commerce, Blog, Portfolio)
Custom Features or Integrations
SEO and Marketing Services
Ongoing Support and Maintenance Requirements
The tool can then generate a detailed quote based on these inputs, giving you and your clients a clear understanding of costs. Here's an example of how this might look in a spreadsheet:

Service/Feature			Cost Per Unit	Quantity	Total Cost
Base Website Development	£1,500		1		£1,500
Additional sections		£200		5		£1,000
E-commerce Module		£1,200		1		£1,200
SEO Services			£500		1		£500
Bespoke Scripting		£1,000		1		£1,000

Total Initial Cost		£5,200

Ongoing Monthly Maintenance	£150		12		£1,800

This example can be expanded on.
